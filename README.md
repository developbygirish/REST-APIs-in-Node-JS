REST APIs in Node JS

Hi Everyone, in this project I learned to make RESTFUL API and perform CRUD operations using POSTMAN in the NODEJS express server.
There is a JSON file with data on it, I perform a GET Request to get that data on the client side on the route (/api/user).
I also render that data on HTML doc on route (/user)

I perform POST request to add new user on JSON data using route (/api/user) and I also use express.urlencoded middleware to parse that data come from the client to req.body.

I perform DELETE request to delete eisting data using route (api/user/:id) :id for dynamic routing

I perform PATCH request to update existing data using route (api/user/:id) :id for dynamic routing.

I take the reference from piyush garg YouTube channel to make this.
